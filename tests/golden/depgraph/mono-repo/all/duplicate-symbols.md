# Duplicate Symbols

**Generated**: <DATE> (by tools/create-dependency-graph)

Names that are OWN-DEFINED (not merely re-exported) by >= 2 distinct files across the monorepo, then CLASSIFIED (see `DupEntryTag`) so the actionable subset is clear: `TRUE_DUPLICATE` (real merge targets) vs `DISPATCH_VARIANT` (>=2 `mathTyped(...)` registrations of the same public name — distinct dispatch surfaces, Bucket C delegation candidates, not copy-paste bodies), `ALIAS_DELEGATION` (a `const X = importedY` forward, excluded once <2 real bodies remain), and `ALLOWLISTED` (matches `duplicate-allowlist.json`: hot-path `is*` guards, AssemblyScript mirrors, per-package `VERSION` strings).

> **Note:** This report groups names by OWN definition, not by call graph, then classifies each flagged name (see DupEntryTag): TRUE_DUPLICATE (the actionable merge targets), DISPATCH_VARIANT (>=2 mathTyped(...) registrations of the same public name — distinct dispatch surfaces, Bucket C delegation candidates, not copy-paste bodies), ALIAS_DELEGATION (a const-alias forward to an imported symbol, not an independent body — excluded once fewer than 2 real bodies remain), and ALLOWLISTED (matches duplicate-allowlist.json: hot-path is* guards, AssemblyScript mirrors, per-package VERSION strings). NOT detected: same-file typed-dispatch overload polymorphism for different argument shapes within one registration — a human still triages TRUE_DUPLICATE entries using the defining files + public flags before merging anything.
